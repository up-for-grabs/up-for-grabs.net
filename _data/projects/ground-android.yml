  Ground is an open-source, map-first data collection and analysis platform built to seamlessly connect
  the offline world with cloud-based storage and computation. The platform consists of a web app for data
  management and an Android app for offline data collection. Our goal is to provide a "just right" data
  collection solution that meets the needs of community organizers, conservationists, humanitarian workers,
  and researchers addressing some of today's most pressing issues.
