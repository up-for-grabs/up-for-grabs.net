name: Mission Pinball Framework
desc: >-
  The Mission Pinball Framework (“MPF”) is a free Python-based pinball software framework that’s used
  to run real pinball machines. It allows both casual builders and hard-core programmers to create the
  software to run their pinball machines—whether it’s new game code for an existing pinball machine, a
  “re-theme” of an old machine, or totally custom / homebrew machine built from scratch.
